From self-learning coding to the ease with which she applies UX frameworks, to her confident and inspiring presentation skills, she's been nothing but brilliant. Clients absolutely love her, and the account she has been working on has significantly grown, due to the brilliant work she's been doing. I have immense respect for how much energy and passion she spends on learning, she made our team so much better since she has joined in so many ways, from working on our progression framework, to systematising our library, to proactively leading research on design ops and looking at how it can help improve the whole organization beyond our team.‚Äù</p>

Kirsten came in with buckets of enthusiasm, calmness, positivity, quickly onboarded and got stuck in. She took the initiative to implement efficiencies in the project, making things smoother and more manageable for me and the team. She was instrumental to that projects success. We now both look back on it with pride. </p>
