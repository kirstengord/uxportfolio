            </div>
            <div class="mt-3 col-lg-12">
              <p><b>When does the error happen?</b> I spent a day reading through every related complaint made in the past 3 months and watching any linked SessionCam videos. The budget did not have room for any usability testing so this research helped to give me a clear understanding of when the error was occuring. If someone chose an off-peak departure time and a return time that was during peak time the search results page would allow the customer to choose an off-peak return ticket but when they moved foward in the purchase journey they were given an error. Reading the complaints and watching the videos showed me just how frustrating this was for customers.
            <br><br><b>Why does the error happen?</b> Understanding why this error was occurring required extensive conversations with the company's tech team and developers. It was a major problem with their backend system and how it pulled through results for return tickets. The research I did helped the team understand the extent and serious implications of the problem.
            <br><br><b>How often does it occur?</b> In order for me to answer this question I needed to look at analytics specific to journeys in which this error message occured. Unfortunately the tags were not set up for this so I wasn't able to obtain the quantitative data I was after. I did advise the client to set this up immediately in case they had any pushback on development costs to implement the solution. My hypothesis was that the analytics would have shown high drop off rates for journeys in which this error occurred.

              <p>Rather than just describe the problem with screenshots, I started the workshop by showing the client actual footage from SessionCam of real customers struggling with the error and then trying to find information to recover from it. Then I read the Usabilla complaint that was connected to the footage. In doing this I shifted the focus away from "We are losing money." to "Wow. Our customers are really frustrated." This shift was extremely important. Rather than just improve the error message (the cheaper, easier option), the client was now on board with preventing the error altogether to create a truly better experience for their customers.</p>
